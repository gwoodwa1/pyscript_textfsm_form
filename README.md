# Pyscript Textfsm Form using NTC Templates
Using Pyscript create a form where a text file can be uploaded and parsed using TextFSM templates
Form is completely standalone and does not require hosting. 

Must have access to the Internet though to reach the pyscript CDN

Just copy or clone the **index.html** and **tabledemo.html** files and open up in your browser. Tested on Chrome but should work with other browsers
